Interactive tool to learn more about logistic regression and stroke predictions. Sidebar panel contains some menu items one of which brought you here. Good Job üôåüèª. 

Context - This app uses a dataset from Kaggle based on Stroke Predictions. It houses multiple different factors that could play into predicting if someone had a stroke or not. 
This app fits a vanilla logistic model (to make it lightweight on shinyapps.io) and allows you to make predictions based on user inputs. It also allows the adjustment of 
training and holdout proportions and various other graphs to investigate predictions.
 
Play around with it and try to break it :).

Report any issues you find.
